#1.1 Think About Time Reflection


I learnt about the growth mindset, time boxing using pomodoro technique, changing my behavior by forming tiny habits and the tricks to help me get into the zone and experience the state of flow. Time Boxing means that instead of completing a task and review how much time is spent, I should stop working after a certain period of time expires. I find this idea very useful because currently I do not have a very strategic or systematic way to manage my time. Usually I procrastinate and hardly focus on one task until a point of time where I feel the urgency to complete that particular task. Hence, I am very interested to try some of the concepts that I learned, including the pomodoro technique, the formation of tiny habits and discovering the trigger to enter the state of flow. Take my Phase 0 journey as an example:
I will try to make every short task as my tiny habit. For example, after I finish a meal, I will start doing a short task.
Time box my phase 0 tasks using Pomodoro technique. i.e. Concentrate for 25mins and rest for 5mins
Break down evey task until I feel it is not too difficult and not too easy, so that it is meaningful to me and help to get into the zone.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection


What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands, and Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.



2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging part is to memorise all the commands and apply to them in the extra questions under "DO MORE" of the Command Line Crash Course. Another challenging part is the command - env. I am still not quite sure how to use it in real life situation



3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes.



4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think the most important commands are:

pwd, cd, mkdir, mv, rm, cp, grep, ls



5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd

print working directory



-ls

list directory



-mv

move a file or directory / rename a file or directory



-cd

change directory



-../

Go back to the previous layer of directory



-touch

create a new and empty file



-mkdir

create a new and empty diretory



-less

Page through a file



-rmdir

remove a directory



-rm

remove a file or directory



-help

show a list of commands

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection


If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
how to create a new repo

1. First log in to GitHub

2. On the top right hand corner you will see your profile picture. Beside it you will see a "+" button

3. Click on the "+" button, and then select "New repository"

4. And then you enter your desired repository name, and the click the button "Create repository" at the bottom

how to fork a repo

1. You click into the repo that you want to fork

2. On the top right hand corner you see "Unwatch", "Star" and "Fork", you select "Fork"

3. And then you select which profile you would the repo to be forked to (this step does not show up if you only have 1 profile)

how to clone a repo

1. Click into the repo that you would like to clone on GitHub, then copy the HTTPS

2. You open the command line (e.g. Terminal)

3. You cd to the directory where you want to placed the cloned repo

4. You type the command "git clone [paste your HTTPS here]"



What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
Not really. I learn how to set up git and GitHub by using the command lines. One little struggle here is I am not so sure how to manage my branches and how to use sublime. For example if I created a branch called "new-branch", after I clone the "p0-cli-exploration" to my computer, the branch will be shifted to "master" automatically.
