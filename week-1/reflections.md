#1.1 Think About Time Reflection


I learnt about the growth mindset, time boxing using pomodoro technique, changing my behavior by forming tiny habits and the tricks to help me get into the zone and experience the state of flow. Time Boxing means that instead of completing a task and review how much time is spent, I should stop working after a certain period of time expires. I find this idea very useful because currently I do not have a very strategic or systematic way to manage my time. Usually I procrastinate and hardly focus on one task until a point of time where I feel the urgency to complete that particular task. Hence, I am very interested to try some of the concepts that I learned, including the pomodoro technique, the formation of tiny habits and discovering the trigger to enter the state of flow. Take my Phase 0 journey as an example:
I will try to make every short task as my tiny habit. For example, after I finish a meal, I will start doing a short task.
Time box my phase 0 tasks using Pomodoro technique. i.e. Concentrate for 25mins and rest for 5mins
Break down evey task until I feel it is not too difficult and not too easy, so that it is meaningful to me and help to get into the zone.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection


What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands, and Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system.



2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging part is to memorise all the commands and apply to them in the extra questions under "DO MORE" of the Command Line Crash Course. Another challenging part is the command - env. I am still not quite sure how to use it in real life situation



3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes.



4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think the most important commands are:

pwd, cd, mkdir, mv, rm, cp, grep, ls



5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd
