Describe what open source means.

Open source means the work is shared to the others free-of-charge and also allow others to build on and share their code. Basically to allow softwares to be freely used, modified and shared.


What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source is a good way to innovate and bring evolution to a software. In some sense it does make me a bit nervous since my code can be free used anyway. However, I believe this risk can be mitigated by the open-source licenses, which I can get credit for my contribution as the original creator. Hence, I believe with better education of people on intellectual property and the better use of open source licensing, it will not be a utopia.


Assess the importance of using licenses.

To protect the owner and guarantee that he/she gets the credit as the original contributor and enjoys the right of use, modification and distribution
