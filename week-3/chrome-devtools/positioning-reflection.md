1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Firstly open the html file using Chrome, and then press option+command+I (for mac). On your righ hand side, you can change the code in "Elements" and "Styles" to see the changes without changing the actual source code.


2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

First you select the element that you want to change under the tab "Elements", and then under the tab "Styles", you resize the elements by defining its height and width inside the class - element.style


3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute: An element with position: absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor

Fixed: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

An element with position: static is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

An element with position: relative is positioned relative to its normal position.

4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin means the space between the border and the element outside the border.
Border means the line framing the content box.
Padding means the space between the boarder and the actual content box.

5. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I love this challenge because I learned some new concept about DOM and chrome devtool. I hate this challenge too because I am still so confused about DOM (is it just the code panal after I click command+option+I in chrome?) as in when do we use Javascript for DOM.
