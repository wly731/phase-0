Being an abstract sequential learner, I mostly agree with the conclusion of the test, particularly to this part:Â 

They learn best when:

- they have access to experts or references
When I got stuck, I need to get clarfication before I feel comfortable to move on. Hence, I tend to stop, look for someone who can help and ask a bunch of questions if I do not grasp a concept well. In view of this, I feel really supported since all the guides and tutors in DBC are very helpful and responsive to my questions.

- placed in stimulating environments
I feel most motivated when I see strong individuals making achievement or when I work with inspirational people. I believe that DBC is a place with inspiratinal people with diverse background and I am really looking forward to meeting every single one of them!

- able to work alone
Every time I learn new stuff, I need time to digest and apply. For for time serving this purpose I prefer a quality and quiet time which I can work and think alone.

Up till now, I had a few struggles, which also echo with some of the conclusions of the test which tells the difficulty of abstract sequential learner:

- Being forced to work with those of differing views
When I encounter somebody with very different views, I will feel stuck and hard to proceed. I always spend too much time just to be diplomatic when convincing others.

- Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly
When I learn something I always want to make sure I have more than enough time to study, digest and re-visit. Hence, during the tight schedule of Phase 0, sometimes I feel like I only have time to learn the basics but not to master a concept.

To equip myself to learn quickly and effectively in DBC, I have to square out individual time so that I can fully focus on the course work without the interruption from others. Also I need to fully embrace a growth mindset and remind myself not to afraid anymore that I will expose my weakness to the others. Stay humble, stay hungry. I hope that I can try my best to get the most out of DBC.
