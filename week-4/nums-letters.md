* What does puts do?

"puts" returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line. It stands for put string.

* What is an integer? What is a float?

Integer is a number without any decimal point. Float is a number with any decimal point.

* What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

For float division, the console will try to return the exact answer (even with decimal points). For interger division, when the computer can’t get the “right” answer, it always rounds down and returns an integer answer.

* Hours in a year

``` puts 24*365 ```

* Minutes in a decade

``` puts 60*24*365*10 ```

* How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Addition: ``` + ```

Subtraction ``` - ```

Multiplication ``` * ```

Division ``` / ```

* What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

String is a group of letters, numbers or puntuations, baiscally any character. We would use them when we want to hold and display words or text, which are bascially a group of characters.

* What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables defined inside a method and can only be used in that method. We would want to use this when we want to separate this method-specific variable from other variables so that it cannot be accessed and changed by other methods.


* How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Yes I had a good refrehser on my previous knowledge on Ruby. This challenge is not too difficult.
