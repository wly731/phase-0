<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Interesting, I find a bit challenging because when it comes to a practical situation I have to think how to create a desired layout using different tags.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We used the <table> tags
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We just inserted every content first and ignored all the formatting stuff.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Good: Quite easy to understand, it is more like a human language, more readable
Bad: Quite slow in tying the code because most of the time we need an open tag and a close tag
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
for the sematic elements like creating a table, it is easier to remember e.g. tr = table row, td = table data.
